We worked on understanding a quantum algorithm for the Monte Carlo pricing of financial derivatives.The paper we studied shows
how the relevant probability distributions can be prepared in quantum superposition, the payoff functions can be implemented via quantum circuits, and the price of financial derivatives can be extracted via quantum measurements.It shows how the amplitude estimation algorithm can be applied to achieve a quadratic quantum speedup in the number of steps required to obtain an estimate for the price with high confidence.[ref1]

We studied a simple and efficient process for generating a quantum superposition of states which form a discrete approximation of any efficiently integrable (such as log concave) probability density functions.[ref2]

We also studied an algorithm estimates the expected output value of an arbitrary randomized or quantum subroutine with bounded variance, achieving a near-quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm. Combining the algorithm with the use of quantum walks gives a quantum speedup of the fastest known classical algorithms with rigorous performance bounds for computing partition functions, which use multiple-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The quantum algorithm can also be used to estimate the total variation distance between probability distributions efficiently.[ref3]
