Steps to run:
1. Set the the state to be sent through the quantum channel

2. In the quantum channel section of code introduce bit flip error.

3. Run the code.

4. Observe the last qubit of every term as a linear combination (qubits are outputted in reverse order) it will be same as input sent.
